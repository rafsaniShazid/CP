## 1. ðŸ“Š Calculating Median in a Sorted Array

```cpp
forr(i, 0, n) {
    if (abs(i - (n - 1 - i)) <= 1) {
        mini = min(mini, arr[i]); // potential median candidates
        mx = max(mx, arr[i]);     // includes the integers between them
    }
}
``` 
let's assume an array, arr={a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>,..,a<sub>n</sub>}<br>
for each a<sub>i</sub> , suppose p is the number of left elements and q is the number of right elements.<br>
then the median elements will be the a<sub>i</sub> for which |p-q|<=1.<br>
so we can simply run a loop where, <br>
p = i and q = n-1-i. So the equation would be, |i-(n-1-i)|<=1.<br>

## the minimum multiple of i that is strictly bigger than lâˆ’1   
```cpp
    ll a= ((l-1)/i+1)*i;
```
## 2. âš¡ Modular Exponentiation

Use this when you need to perform large exponentiation like `2^1e5 % mod` or cases where `1 << 1e5` would overflow.

```cpp

// Computes (base^exp) % mod efficiently
ll power(ll base, ll exp, ll mod) {
    ll res = 1;
    while (exp) {
        if (exp & 1)
            res = (res * base) % mod;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```
## 3. Taking decisions for min and max of two pointers
```cpp
forr(i,0,n){
        if(i&1){
            takeleft= arr[l]<arr[r];
        }
        else takeleft= arr[l]>arr[r];

        if(takeleft){
            cout<<"L"; l++;
        }
        else {
            cout<<"R"; r--;
        }
    }
