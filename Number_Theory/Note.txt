1765M - Minimum LCM
Suppose a≤b
. Let's show that if bmoda≠0
, the answer is suboptimal. If bmoda=0
, then LCM(a,b)=b
, so the answer is less than n
. But if bmoda≠0
, then LCM(a,b)
 is at least 2b
, and b
 is at least n2
, so in this case, the answer is at least n
.

Okay, now we know that in the optimal answer, bmoda=0
. This also means that nmoda=0
, since n=a+b
. So we need to search for a
 only among the divisors of n
, and it is possible to iterate through all of them in O(n0.5)
.
